# Persistent Project Memory

## Product

A local-first data collection platform focused primarily on Google Maps
Platform workflows.

## User objective

Build a complete application rather than a single scraper script.

## Primary workflow

``` text
Project
 → Configuration
 → Validation
 → Job
 → Queue
 → Worker
 → Provider
 → Normalize
 → Validate
 → Deduplicate
 → MySQL
 → Dashboard
 → Export
```

## Technology decisions

-   Next.js
-   TypeScript
-   FastAPI
-   Python
-   SQLAlchemy
-   Alembic
-   MySQL
-   Redis
-   Playwright only where appropriate/permitted
-   Pandas
-   Pytest
-   Git

## Development decision

Start without Docker.

## Architecture decision

Use provider adapters so Google-specific code is isolated.

## Data decision

MySQL is the durable system of record.

## Queue decision

Redis is coordination only.

## Safety decision

Do not bypass CAPTCHA, anti-bot, authentication, rate limits, or other
access controls.

## Current phase

Phase 1 (Local foundation).

## Current task

T001 --- Coding standards. (T000 complete.)

## Repository

Git initialized locally; remote `origin` =
https://github.com/SauravDnj/Data-Web-Scraping.git (empty at time of
first push). Layout created: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `workers`, `tests`,
`database`, `scripts`, `docs`.

## Resolved design decisions (recorded at T000)

The docs pack contained several unreconciled disagreements across
different files. Resolved as follows so later tasks are unambiguous:

-   **Backend layout**: use `apps/api` (matches T000_PROMPT.md and
    `02_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`), not a root-level `backend/`. Internal
    module breakdown when scaffolded (T014+) follows
    `docs/24_BACKEND_FILE_PLAN.md`:
    `apps/api/app/{api,core,db,domain,services,repositories,providers,pipeline,schemas}`.
-   **Job state machine**: canonical states are
    `draft → queued → running → {completed, partially_completed,
    failed, cancelled, paused}`, with `paused` re-entrant to `running`.
    Apply this in T031 (job state machine) and T024 (job database).
-   **Provider interface naming**: use the generic `ProviderAdapter`
    contract (`validate_config`, `estimate`, `collect`, `normalize`,
    `classify_error`); `GoogleMapsProvider` (T041--T044) implements
    this contract exactly rather than using its own differently-named
    methods.
-   **Dedup canonical key scope**: include `project_scope` in the
    canonical key (`project_scope + provider + provider_id`) to avoid
    cross-project collisions. Apply in T052 (canonical identity).

## Last decision

Build the platform incrementally and keep documentation synchronized
with implementation.
